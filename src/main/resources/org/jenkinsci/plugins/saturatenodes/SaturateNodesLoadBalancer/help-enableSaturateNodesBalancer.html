    <p>By default Jenkins is using consistent hashing algorithm for load balancing.
    It always tries to execute job on the node there it was executed before.
    This approach has one big disadvantage in case of cloud based CI - it keeps a lot of nodes up and running.</p>
    Saturate Nodes Load Balancer addresses this issue using pretty simple approach:
    <ul>
        <li>select node with applicable label</li>
        <li>it orders node based on connection time (time then node was connected to Jenkins master)</li>
        <li>pick-up first available executor</li>
    </ul>
  As result it should minimise number of used nodes.
