    <p>By default Jenkins uses a consistent hashing algorithm for load balancing:
    It always tries to execute a job on the same node where it was executed before.
    This approach has one big disadvantage in case of cloud based CI - it keeps a lot of nodes up and running.</p>

    The Saturate Nodes Load Balancer plugin addresses this issue using a pretty simple algorithm:
    <ul>
        <li>Select nodes of the specified label.</li>
        <li>Order node based on the time it was connected to the Jenkins master.</li>
        <li>Pick-up the available executor.</li>
    </ul>

    As a result it should minimize the number of used nodes.
